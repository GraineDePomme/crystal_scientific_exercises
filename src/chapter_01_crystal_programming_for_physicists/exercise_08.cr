# EXERCISE 8 : PLANETARY ORBITS =========================================================
# 
# The orbit in space of one body around another, such as a planet around the Sun, does
# not have to be circular. In general it takes the form of an ellipse, with the body
# something closer in and sometimes further out. If you are given the distance l1 of
# closest approach that a planet makes to the Sun (also called its perihelion), and its
# linear velocity v1 at perihelion, then any other property of the orbit can be 
# calculated from these two.
# 
# Kepler's second law tells us that the distance l2 and velocity v2 of the planet at
# its most distant point (or aphelion) satisfy l2 * v2 = l1 * v1.
# At the same time, the total energy (kinematic plus gravitational) of a planet with
# velocity v and distance r from the Sun is given by:
# 
#       E = 0.5 * m * v^2 - G * m * M / r
# 
# where m is the planet's mass, M is the mass of the Sun, and G is Newton's
# gravitational constant.
# 
# Ultimately, we can say that v2 is the smaller root of the quadatic equation
# 
#       v2^2 - (2 * G * M) / (v1 * l1) - (v1^2 - 2 * G * M / l1) = 0
# 
# Once we have v2 we can calculate l2 using Kepler's second law.
# 
# Given the values of v1, l1, and l2, other parameters of the orbit are given by
# simple formulas:
# 
#       Semi-major axis: a = 0.5 * (l1 + l2)
#       Semi-minor axis: b = sqrt(l1 * l2)
#       Orbital period: T = (2 * pi * a * b) / (l1 * v1)
#       Orbital eccentricity: e = (l2 - l1) / (l2 + l1)
# 
# Write a program that takes the distance to the Sun and the velocity of an object
# at perihelion, then calculates and prints the quantities l2, v2, T, e.

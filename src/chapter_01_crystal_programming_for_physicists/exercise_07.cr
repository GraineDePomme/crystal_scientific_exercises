# EXERCISE 7 : QUANTUM POTENTIAL STEP ===================================================
# 
# A particle of mass m with initial kinetic energy E and wavevector k1 = sqrt(2mE)/h_bar
# enters from the left and encounters a sudden jump in potential energy of ehight V
# at position x = 0.
# 
# By solving the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, one can show that when E > V the particle may
# either pass the step, in which case it has a lower kinetic energy E - V on the other
# side and a correspondingly smaller wavevector of k2 = sqrt(2mE - 2mV) / h_bar, or it
# may be reflected, keeping all of its kinetic eergy and an unchanged wavevector but
# moving in the opposite direction. The probabilities T and R for transmission and
# reflection are given by :
# 
#       T = 4 * k1 * k2 / (k1 + k2)^2
#       R = ( (k1 - k2) / (k1 + k2) )^2
# 
# Suppose we have a particle with mass equal to the electron mass and energy 10eV
# encountering a potential step of height 9eV.
# 
# Write a function that computes and print out the transmision and reflection
# probabilities using the formula above.
